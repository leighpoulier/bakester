## About Bakester

Bakester is a Ruby on Rails web app where people can buy "bakes" from home bakers in their local area.  "Bakes" might include cakes, cupcakes, slices, pies, pastries, tarts, desserts etc. A user can place an order for specific bake via the website to a baker, who receives the order and makes the cake and delivers it prior to the requested date.

## The Problem

Many people, particularly those with young kids, may feel pressured to provide an impressive celebration cake for an upcoming event such as a kid's birthday.  The pressures of social media and the demands of the honourary child place the parent in a difficult position, particularly for those without the skills to bake at home.  Non-bakers may look into sourcing a cake from a local supplier, however professionally made cakes can be very expensive, and are oriented more towards large celebrations such as weddings.  Such cakes are outside the budget of most people planning a smaller event, and may be considered overkill, and so this website aims to fill that gap.

The flipside of this situation is someone who DOES have the skills and time to bake at home, and is interested in making a bit of money from those skills. They can post a listing called a "bake" on Bakester, to offer home baked celebration cakes or other items to the general community.

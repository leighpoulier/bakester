## About Bakester

Bakester is a Ruby on Rails web app where people can buy "bakes" from home bakers.  "Bakes" might include cakes, cupcakes, slices, pies, pastries, tarts, desserts etc. On Bakester a home baker can advertise baked items they are able and willing to produce in exchange for payment, and any user can place an order for a specific bake.  The baker receives the order, produces the bake, and delivers it to the customer.

## The Problem

Many people, particularly those with young kids, may feel pressured to provide an impressive celebration cake for an upcoming event such as a kid's birthday.  The pressures of social media and the demands of the honourary child place the parent in a difficult position, particularly for those without the skills to bake at home.

Non-bakers may look into sourcing a cake from a local supplier, however professionally made cakes can be very expensive, and are oriented more towards large celebrations such as weddings.  Such cakes are outside the budget of most people planning a smaller event, and may be considered overkill.  The aim this website aims to fill the gap to provide affordable home baked celebration cakes and other bakes.

The flipside of this situation is someone who DOES have the skills and time to bake at home, and is interested in making a bit of money from those skills. They can post a listing called a "bake" on Bakester, to offer home baked celebration cakes or other items to the general community in exchange for payment.

This web app aims to solve this problem by bringing these two types of users together in a marketplace.
